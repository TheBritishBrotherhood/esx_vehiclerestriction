Restriction script

So ive looked and looked and looked for a restriction script to stop players stealing police vehicles but in a orderly fasion! Like another script that kicks you from the server, TOO HARSH! D:

So here i bring to you a vehicle restriction script that can restrict players without the specific job role stealing emergency vehicles! This resource is light and wont cause any issues.

FEATURES:

If someone with the job POLICE gets into a police vehicle all is well nothing happens. :policeman:
If you dont have the police role the car will not start! and you get a message at the lower part of the screen saying "This vehicle is fitted with a Anti Theft device. :warning:
You can add more then just police cars and police job! Check in both client and server.lua its pretty self explanitory!
Players are still able to get in the passenger seat etc! This only stops players from driving the vehicle!
Finally stop those S*** heads racing in police cars that were not locked by the officer!

Enjoy guys! :smiley:
